# Capstone Project: 2018 - 2023 Cocaine and Fentanyl Analysis

## Overview
Seeking to achieve a better understanding of the adverse effects of the use of cocaine and fentanyl in the US from 2018 - 2023. This motivation was derived from the death of my brother Darnell from overdose of these drugs in November of 2023. I would like to explore the age groups most affected, the number of non-fatal hospital visits, and the number of overdose deaths. It is my assumption that a great number of population have been affected this addiction, most resulting in high hospitalizations (if reported at all) and death.

## Datasets

CDC - DOSE Dashboard: Nonfatal Overdose Emergency Department and Inpatient Hospitalization Discharge Data
